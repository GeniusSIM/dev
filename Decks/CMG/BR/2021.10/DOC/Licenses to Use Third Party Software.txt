Software: SQLite Embedded SQL Database Engine

SQLite Is Public Domain

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies
they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the
public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe
at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use,
compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code
form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in
SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship
with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process
(for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under
other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the
final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with
those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use
the SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code
has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of
code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have
public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is
uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

Obtaining A License To Use SQLite

Even though SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a license,
some users want to obtain a license anyway. Some reasons for obtaining a
license include:

    - Your company desires warranty of title and indemnity against claims of
      copyright infringement.
    - You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the
      public domain.
    - You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right
      of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain.
    - You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have the
      legal right to use and distribute SQLite.
    - Your legal department tells you that you have to purchase a license.

If you feel like you really need to purchase a license for SQLite, Hwaci, the
company that employs the architect and principal developers of SQLite, will
sell you one. All proceeds from the sale of SQLite licenses are used to fund
further improvements to SQLite.

Contributed Code

In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright, all new
contributors to the SQLite code base are asked to dedicate their contributions
to the public domain. If you want to send a patch or enhancement for possible
inclusion in the SQLite source tree, please accompany the patch with the
following statement:

    The author or authors of this code dedicate any and all copyright interest
    in this code to the public domain. We make this dedication for the benefit
    of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and successors. We
    intend this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity
    of all present and future rights to this code under copyright law. 

We are not able to accept patches or changes to SQLite that are not accompanied
by a statement such as the above. In addition, if you make changes or
enhancements as an employee, then a simple statement such as the above is
insufficient. You must also send by surface mail a copyright release signed by
a company officer. A signed original of the copyright release should be mailed
to:

    Hwaci
    6200 Maple Cove Lane
    Charlotte, NC 28269
    USA 

A template copyright release is available in PDF or HTML. You can use this
release to make future changes.
